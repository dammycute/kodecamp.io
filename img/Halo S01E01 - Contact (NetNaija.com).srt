[engine powering up]

4
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:55,664
[indistinct chatter continues]

5
00:00:55,707 --> 00:00:58,145
[woman] Okay, okay.
[laughs]

6
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,711
Eight times!
Eight times!

7
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:02,192
Pretty accurate.
You should be used to it by now.

8
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,976
[woman laughs]

9
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,587
[man, on TV] But rather
than pay a fair price

10
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,023
for our precious deuterium,

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,851
the UNSC leadership on Reach

12
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:10,418
seek to enslave us.

13
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:11,680
New deal.

14
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:12,942
Yeah, let someone else deal.

15
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:14,551
The Professor has sticky hands.

16
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,206
You saying I cheat?

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,729
I'm saying you don't
wash your hands.

18
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:20,210
My hands are filthy with
the blood UNSC marines.

19
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,864
Speech, Professor.

20
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:24,258
Regale us with another one
of your war stories.

21
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,477
[Professor]
I've got scars older than you.

22
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,740
-The things I've...
-"...things I've seen."

23
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:30,568
[man, on TV]
They've repeatedly sent legions

24
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:33,484
of marines and their
super weapons, the Spartans,

25
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,789
to crush us.

26
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:37,271
But war need not be the answer.

27
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:41,144
And that is why Jin Ha
has sent me

28
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,583
and trusts me to negotiate
an end to this endless war.

29
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:46,932
Turn that shite off.

30
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:49,892
As the Bard once wrote,
"Wise--"

31
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:52,329
Vinsher's a fool,
but he's a dangerous fool,

32
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:54,070
giving people false hope.

33
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,854
His peace talks will fail,

34
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:58,205
and the UNSC will come at us
with everything they've got.

35
00:01:58,247 --> 00:01:59,554
You mark me.

36
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:00,816
You mean Spartans?

37
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,513
[laughter]

38
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:05,734
Have you seen a Spartan
up close?

39
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:07,083
I've faced marines.

40
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,476
[laughter]

41
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,130
"I've faced marines."

42
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,394
One Spartan is worth
a hundred marines.

43
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,309
[Professor]
Ah, but, Djanka,

44
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:18,094
there's another difference
between Spartans and marines.

45
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,400
Mm?

46
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:20,966
Marines can be killed.

47
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,407
Spartans aren't human.

48
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,279
They're faster,
stronger, smarter.

49
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,281
They cannot be stopped.

50
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:34,066
They just keep on killing...

51
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,286
without mercy...

52
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,855
till there's nothing left...

53
00:02:40,942 --> 00:02:42,118
to kill.

54
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,605
You in or out?

55
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,302
[laughter]

56
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,220
Jin Ha!

57
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,483
Tell our young one here.

58
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,181
The General knows.

59
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:04,662
Either Madrigal is free,
or it's not.

60
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,490
There's no middle ground.

61
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,188
[man]
Aw, come on!

62
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,147
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Unbelievable.

63
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,498
Everything okay,
General?

64
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:17,240
Where's my daughter?

65
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,851
Probably out wandering...

66
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:21,157
with her friends.

67
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:24,116
You know Kwan.

68
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,253
-[Cara] Slow down!
-[groans]

69
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:32,255
I didn't sign up for this!

70
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:34,953
[panting and groaning]

71
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,305
I am completely shanked.

72
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:42,918
This better be worth it, Kwan.

73
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,312
[Kwan] Less talking,
more looking, Cara.

74
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,575
[Cara] Look, if the General
finds out we left the outpost--

75
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:49,881
[Kwan] What my father
doesn't know won't kill him.

76
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,627
[laughs]

77
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:59,239
I told you I'd find it.

78
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:03,895
Madrigal, the galaxy's highest
concentration of heavy hydrogen.

79
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,810
Power your ships...

80
00:04:05,854 --> 00:04:07,638
and power your drugs.

81
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:14,950
This is why you have to stay,
Kwan, to find shit like this!

82
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,517
[Kwan]
Too bad for you,

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,301
soon as I find a way,

84
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:20,434
I'm getting off
this stupid rock.

85
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:22,566
[Cara]
Where will you even go, Kwan?

86
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,655
The UNSC owns the galaxy.

87
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,048
[Esso]
She's not gonna leave.

88
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,615
She'd miss us too much.

89
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:31,749
Doubters first.

90
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:33,664
-[Cara] Yes!
-[Faaz] Yeah.

91
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:34,926
See you on the other side.

95

-[Neru] Off to plot her escape.

96
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,594
[Cara]
How long before this kicks in?

97
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:52,901
[Neru] My brother says
it's pretty quick.

[Esso]
Kwan, where have you been?

110
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,247
[Kwan] We need to get back
to the outpost.

111
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,771
-Why? What's going on?
-There's a ship out there.

112
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,294
-UNSC?
-I don't think so.

113
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,731
Neru, no, I'm serious!
Come on, Faaz!

A hundred and fifty
dead civilians in Madrigal

348
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:20,214
is not a good look
for your Spartans, Catherine,

349
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,737
even if they were rebels.

350
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,305
The Covenant wiped out
an entire rebel garrison

One survivor's not going
to make my job any easier.

It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

363
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,649
We've been fighting
these alien creatures for years,

364
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:06,608
and we still have no idea what
they want, where to find them,

365
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,262
or how to beat them.

367
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:13,484
If that object can tell us
anything about them,

368
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:16,705
I have a feeling the committee's
concern about dead rebels

369
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,359
will go away.

370
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:20,317
One more thing.

371
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:23,364
They want a friendly face
talking to the survivor.

372
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,279
Miranda Keyes
knows Madrigal.

373
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,803
I've asked her
to do the reach-out.

374
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:29,936
Is that going to be an issue?

375
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,633
No, no, no.

376
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,070
But the Madrigal object
comes straight to my lab

377
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,290
for first analysis
upon arrival.

378
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,597
Alien tech
is Miranda's division.

379
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,815
John found it.

380
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:41,034
It belongs here.

381
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,167
[soft sigh]

382
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,430
[equipment powers up]

383
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:52,611
[equipment pulses
and whirrs]

384
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,917
I told you
that was a nonstarter.

385
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:57,441
We have paused
active development.

386
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,053
You've paused nothing.

387
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,795
Catherine, your genius
has given us

388
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,840
so much to be thankful for.

389
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:07,930
Channel that genius
appropriately and legally.

390
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,672
Get rid of that,
and any others.

391
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,066
-Clear?
-Clear.

392
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:17,287
I've given you a long lead,
Doctor.

393
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,159
Don't hang me with it.

394
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:20,769
[door beeps open]

395
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,469
[door slides closed]

396
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,489
[in alien language]

397
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:31,492
[Makee]

398
00:30:30,524 --> 00:30:32,656
[panting]

399
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,788
Hey.

400
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:38,184
Anybody! Please!

401
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:39,402
Please!

402
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,102
Hey. Hey, you!

403
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,105
[Kwan shouting indistinctly]

404
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,545
[muffled]
Hey! Open the door!

405
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:54,853
Please!

406
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,378
-Open the door!
-[woman] Kwan.

407
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,380
How are you feeling?

408
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,991
Who are you?

409
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:04,906
I'm Miranda Keyes.

410
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,039
I'm talking to you from
the UNSC headquarters on Reach.

411
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,999
So sorry for your loss, Kwan.

412
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:13,393
Despite their differences,

413
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,830
the UNSC respected
the way that Jin Ha

414
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,878
stood up for himself
and the people of Madrigal.

415
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,924
Kwan, I'm not a politician.

416
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,752
I spend my time trying
to understand the aliens

417
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:26,536
that attacked your outpost.

418
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,148
Yours isn't the first planet
to face the Covenant,

419
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:32,455
and, unfortunately,
it won't be the last.

420
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,198
If we don't all join together...

421
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:40,594
I don't know how we're going
to stop them.

422
00:31:40,637 --> 00:31:42,509
You could help us
do that.

423
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:49,168
What does that mean?

424
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:57,916
If you would upload a few words
to the other colonies,

425
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,483
just explaining what you saw,

426
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,311
the brutality of the Covenant,

427
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:05,010
the fact that the Spartans
are actually taking them on,

428
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:07,142
I think that it would go
a long way to putting aside

429
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:09,536
whatever these politicians
are bickering about

430
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,755
and helping us focus
on the real war.

431
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:20,547
My dad spent his life
trying to free us from you...

432
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:24,203
until the day of his murder.

433
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,902
How can you ask me to...

434
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,948
to go on camera and--?

435
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,688
-I understand. I'm not trying--
-No, no, no.

436
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,429
It's a great idea.

437
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:36,215
Yeah, let's do it.

438
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,003
What if I say the UNSC

439
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:44,440
sent a bunch of Spartans
to attack us.

440
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:45,920
That's not true.

441
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,792
They killed over
a hundred innocent people.

442
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,143
Children.

443
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:54,015
And then...

444
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,104
and then you kidnapped me
to force me to say

445
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,627
it was all the aliens.

446
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,194
Kwan, the entire encounter
was recorded.

447
00:32:59,238 --> 00:33:01,414
You people can make video
look like anything.

448
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:06,201
We've seen your Spartan
propaganda broadcasts.

449
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,551
You think the Outer Colonies
don't see through that?

450
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,381
And when they hear
my version,

451
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,080
you can forget about unity
or whatever.

452
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:19,127
Those other colonies
are going to run from the UNSC

453
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,608
as fast as they can.

454
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:25,177
What is it you want?

455
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,442
Independence for Madrigal.

456
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:33,881
That's what my dad wanted.

457
00:33:35,535 --> 00:33:37,537
So that's what I want.

458
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:41,715
Yeah.

459
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:43,412
[sighs]

460
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:45,806
Get some rest.

461
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:48,939
I'll see you on Reach.

462
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,645
[woman] Getting
a red light on hatch 4.

463
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:00,255
[woman 2] Commander Shepherd,
you are requested

464
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,214
at the Skillian Response Center.

465
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:05,652
[sobbing softly]

466
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:24,931
[John, over monitor]
Retrieving now.

467
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,024
[soft gasp]

468
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,982
Biometrics
are all over the map.

469
00:34:33,897 --> 00:34:37,161
Body temperature is up.
It's up.

470
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:39,206
Lymphatics,
they're ignited.

471
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:42,993
Elevated activity
in his hypothalamus

472
00:34:43,036 --> 00:34:44,647
and pineal glands.

473
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,431
Look, look.

474
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:50,088
The energy pulse is stimulating
his connective tissue.

475
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,829
All this from contact
with a piece of rock.

476
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:56,224
Has he said anything?

477
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,486
No.

478
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,142
How long until they're back?

479
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:03,710
-Better part of a day.
-Okay.

480
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:05,320
Sierra 1-1-7.

481
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:06,974
[computerized voice]
Connecting.

482
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:09,716
[over intercom]
Dr. Halsey. Status report.

483
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:13,154
Returning from Twenty-Three
Librae, Planet Madrigal,

484
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,113
with a single survivor.

485
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,245
Covenant disarmed,
one escapee.

486
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:20,596
And your neural lace metrics,
any anomalies?

487
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,035
[sighs]

488
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,560
I saw things...

489
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,128
when I touched the object.

490
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,610
What kind of things?

491
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:38,658
Woods.

492
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:39,876
A white dog.

493
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,923
A family.

494
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,363
A family?

495
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,065
That's what it felt like.

496
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,201
Okay.

497
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:02,943
John...

498
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:05,337
until we know more
about that object,

499
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,165
I'd like you to keep
your distance from it.

500
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:11,125
Copy that.

501
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:15,042
You've been through a lot, John.

502
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:18,480
So, whatever's happened,
you get yourself back here

503
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,700
and we will sort it out, okay?

504
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:24,007
[John]
Yes, ma'am.

505
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:25,748
-Sierra out.
-[intercom beeps off]

506
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,186
I need live updates every
ten minutes streamed to me,

507
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:31,580
and when he lands,
you bring him straight here.

508
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,103
Yes, ma'am.

509
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:35,454
Okay.

510
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,343
Please, open the door.
Please--

511
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:05,048
-[beeps]
-[computer] Identification.

512
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:08,008
Master Chief, Petty Officer,
John 1-1-7.

513
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,098
What are you doing?

514
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:13,318
Scanning the integrity
of all bio interfaces

515
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,320
for evidence
of abnormalities.

516
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,715
That your way of saying
you don't feel well?

517
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:20,934
Checking systems.

518
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,767
[computer pinging]

519
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,334
Yes.

520
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:34,861
You gonna live?

521
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:36,689
Yes.

522
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:39,169
Hey.

523
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,218
There anything to eat
on this ship?

524
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,658
[equipment whirrs]

525
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,362
[indistinct chatter]

526
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:05,761
Heard you played politician
today with the rebel girl.

527
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:07,328
Dad, I tried.

528
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,375
I sucked up my pride,
and I really--

529
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,724
I gave it my best.

530
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,639
I believe you.

531
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:17,599
Selling Dr. Halsey's Spartans
to a rebel, of all people.

532
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:20,602
As if Halsey'd ever
do a thing to promote me.

533
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,562
-That's not entirely fair.
-Please don't. Don't defend her.

534
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,868
She's done nothing
but throw roadblocks in my way.

535
00:38:25,912 --> 00:38:28,349
Halsey's always been
single-minded.

536
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,438
Work is the only thing
that matters.

537
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,353
I made my peace with that
a long time ago.

538
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,487
It's nothing personal.

539
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,663
"Nothing personal"
isn't a great excuse

540
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,317
when it's your mom.

541
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,320
[man] Blood, ocular fluid,
glandular extracts,

542
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,322
and bone samples
sent to external lab...

543
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,672
You know,
you are a lot like her.

544
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,152
[scoffs]
Ouch.

545
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,198
I mean that as a compliment.

546
00:38:53,156 --> 00:38:54,506
Anyway...

547
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:56,551
I'm guessing the UNSC

548
00:38:56,595 --> 00:39:00,381
isn't about to grant Madrigal
complete independence.

549
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:01,730
Mnh-mnh.

550
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,732
So what happens now,
to the girl?

551
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,996
That's what I came over here
to tell you.

552
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,521
Tell me what?

553
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:12,219
Kwan Ha was badly wounded

554
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:15,309
in the alien attack
on Madrigal.

555
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,400
Despite our best efforts,
she succumbed to her injuries.

556
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:20,836
I-I spoke to her,
and she was fine.

557
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,577
What--? What injuries?

558
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,624
Dad.

559
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,716
You didn't order an Article 72.

560
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:35,285
Came from up top.

561
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:38,201
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

562
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,073
Well, then you're okay
with this?

563
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,857
It's not about being okay.

564
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,120
No, it's about keeping
the deuterium flowing,

565
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,557
regardless of the cost.

566
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,648
-It is not that simple.
-It is that simple.

567
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,345
It's-it's an Article 72.

568
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:55,218
We're murdering
a teenage girl...

569
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,744
and I'm complicit.

570
00:39:58,787 --> 00:40:01,094
We're in a war, Miranda.

571
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,965
The future of humanity--

572
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:04,358
What's the point
in saving humanity

573
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,447
if we're going to give up
our own?

574
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:11,104
Sometimes you have to make hard
choices to get good results.

575
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,589
Now who's sounding like Halsey?

576
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,040
You don't eat?

577
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:37,478
Didn't see anything I liked.

578
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,045
Yeah?

579
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:40,394
What is it you like?

580
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:44,137
Nuts. Bolts.

581
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,617
Microchips.

582
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:50,839
-That was a joke.
-Yeah, no, I get it.

583
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:53,363
Hilarious.

584
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,543
You ever take that thing off?

585
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:02,285
All of my diagnostic command
and control systems

586
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,939
run through here.

587
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:05,332
I need it.

588
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:10,511
Master Chief, huh?

589
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:12,600
You know we've actually met
before today.

590
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:15,734
When was this?

591
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,999
When you killed my mother.

592
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,570
She was at a meeting.

593
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:32,185
Outer Colonists getting together
to talk about how the UNSC

594
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:34,840
was stripping us
of all our natural resources.

595
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,755
But before they got
into all that,

596
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:39,235
you and three other
Spartans showed up,

597
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:42,717
responding to an insurrectionist
bomb threat.

598
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:45,067
But, see, that never made
much sense, because why would--?

599
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:46,504
Why would insurrectionists

600
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:48,462
blow up a meeting
for insurrectionists?

601
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,205
Yeah.

602
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:56,905
We were ordered
to eliminate the organizer.

603
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:00,039
And the orders changed.

604
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:02,868
To what?

605
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,957
The assembled were deemed
an imminent threat.

606
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,959
My mom seemed like
an imminent threat to you?

607
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:08,787
What I can see on the ground
may not reflect

608
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,528
the entirety
of the situation.

609
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,616
-What does that mean?
-Sometimes...

610
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,574
others know things I do not.

611
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,837
It ever occur to you that it
might work the other way around?

612
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:20,799
Then you question everything?

613
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:22,322
And someone told you
that's bad?

614
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,544
Of course they did.

615
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,940
It's funny, I...

616
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:36,075
I don't look at pictures
of my mom that often, but...

617
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:38,294
you...

618
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:41,950
you're everywhere.

619
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:45,998
Can't turn around without
staring at an uplink

620
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,391
about humanity's
best weapon.

621
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:52,570
[sighs]

622
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:55,877
[rapid computerized beeping]

623
00:43:02,188 --> 00:43:03,450
What is your name?

624
00:43:04,538 --> 00:43:06,496
Kwan Ha.

625
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,545
How much longer
are we stuck in here?

626
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,028
ETA is still several hours.

627
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:17,769
And then what?

628
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:22,600
That's still being
worked out.

629
00:43:46,885 --> 00:43:48,800
[Halsey]
So, what's the problem?

630
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:50,366
Roll it back for her.

631
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:51,672
Yes, ma'am.

632
00:43:51,716 --> 00:43:54,196
[overlapping chatter]

633
00:43:56,982 --> 00:43:58,287
What's he doing?

634
00:43:58,331 --> 00:43:59,462
Wait for it.

635
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:08,907
Captain, does Master Chief
know the girl is Article 72?

636
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,040
Of course. It would have been
communicated to him.

637
00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:15,130
Dr. Halsey, what's wrong
with 1-1-7?

638
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:18,003
Nothing, it's just
a neurochemical glitch

639
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:20,962
caused by a power surge
to his prefrontal cortex.

640
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,747
It's not nothing.

641
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,619
Rather than execute the rebel
as ordered,

642
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,187
he has decided to kill
the video feed from his ship.

643
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,841
What's going on?

644
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,149
I think he's having memories.

645
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:36,151
What?

646
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:37,500
Of?

647
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,415
His parents.

648
00:44:39,459 --> 00:44:41,853
I thought you'd sealed
those memories.

649
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:44,246
[Halsey] He's not even certain
that they're his memories.

650
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,379
For the moment,
they're just visions.

651
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:48,686
Then why violate procedure?

652
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,950
I don't know.

653
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,432
Not knowing why
a walking killing machine

654
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,565
is doing what it's doing

655
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,785
is a risk that cannot
be taken.

656
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:02,743
I agree completely,

657
00:45:02,787 --> 00:45:05,746
which is precisely why
the Cortana system could prove--

658
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,401
There is no Cortana system,
Catherine.

659
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:11,447
No cloning, no Cortana.
Is that clear?

660
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:15,364
Now get your Spartan
under control.

661
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:18,977
-[door hisses open]
-What's happening?

662
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:25,548
Something is...

663
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,029
wrong.

664
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:29,683
I can't breathe.

665
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,079
What are you doing?

666
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,692
[technician]
Ship's oxygen levels dropping.

667
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,216
I need to...

668
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:52,358
Kwan.

669
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:54,577
Take down the oxygen
in 1-1-7's suit.

670
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,928
Don't drop the O2 below 40.
I want him unconscious,

671
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:58,364
-not dead.
-Yes, ma'am.

672
00:45:58,407 --> 00:45:59,669
Can the girl survive this?

673
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:01,106
I thought you wanted her dead.

674
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:03,848
[alarm beeping]

675
00:46:05,284 --> 00:46:06,633
[wheezes]

676
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:08,766
[alarm beeping continues]

677
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:12,900
-It's over there.
-Here.

678
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:15,816
It's holding at 40%.
He's unconscious.

679
00:46:26,218 --> 00:46:27,785
[gasps]

680
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:38,404
I'm getting a report of access
to panel Alpha 1-6.

681
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:41,189
If he's unconscious, how come
he's opening panels in the ship?

682
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,931
-What's in A-1-6?
-Atmosphere controls.

683
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:47,108
-[air hissing]
-[John sighs]

684
00:46:47,152 --> 00:46:48,980
[technician] Oxygen levels
are returning to normal.

685
00:46:50,982 --> 00:46:52,897
What sort of weapons
is the ship carrying?

686
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,550
John is not going to fire on us.

687
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,161
I think it's safe to say
you don't know

688
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:57,902
what Master Chief is going to do
at this point.

689
00:46:57,945 --> 00:47:00,078
[Keyes] Ship's flying on AI.
We have control.

690
00:47:00,121 --> 00:47:01,470
I'll send an escort of Pelicans.

691
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:03,342
I need more than an escort,
Captain.

692
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,647
Put out the alarm.

693
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,214
Scramble everyone
to landing bay,

694
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:07,999
full squadron protocol.

695
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,827
Due respect,
we are talking about

696
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,916
our most important
military asset.

697
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,526
We are not taking any chances.

698
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:15,093
Let me investigate.
I'll speak to John,

699
00:47:15,136 --> 00:47:16,877
and whatever influence
this object's--

700
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:19,097
Question one more order, Doctor,

701
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,055
and you can watch
from your lab.

702
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,539
[alarm blaring]

703
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:29,455
[soldier 1]
Come on! Let's go! Move!

704
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:31,370
-Move out!
-[soldier 2] Let's go! Let's go!

705
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:32,719
Move your ass out! Go!

706
00:47:32,762 --> 00:47:34,764
Move, move, move!

707
00:47:34,808 --> 00:47:36,766
[soldiers shouting]

708
00:47:41,249 --> 00:47:42,598
Clear.

709
00:48:31,256 --> 00:48:32,997
[Halsey, over intercom]
Silver team,

710
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,825
Master Chief
has been compromised

711
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,003
by the object you located
on Madrigal.

712
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:42,920
Because of this, he's no longer
able to comply with orders.

713
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:45,139
You've been dispatched
by Fleet Command

714
00:48:45,183 --> 00:48:47,402
to neutralize him.

715
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:49,361
-I'm superseding those orders.
-[man] Move!

716
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:51,015
Whatever he's experiencing,

717
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:53,800
there are other
available solutions.

718
00:48:53,843 --> 00:48:55,410
When that ship lands,

719
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:58,936
I want you to secure
and protect Master Chief

720
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,460
from anyone who actively
threatens his life,

721
00:49:01,503 --> 00:49:03,070
whatever the circumstances.

722
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:05,768
Engage friendlies, ma'am?

723
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,901
If they go after Chief,
they're not friendlies.

724
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,295
Correct, Dr. Halsey?

725
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:11,949
Correct.

726
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:20,740
[engine powering up]

727
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,237
Kwan.

728
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,716
Don't move.

729
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,109
You're gonna need
to listen to me.

730
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:43,763
What did you do to me?

731
00:49:43,806 --> 00:49:45,678
Stop messing
with that stuff.

732
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:48,202
UNSC changed the air mixture,
not me.

733
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:50,030
Why should I trust you?

734
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:53,512
I am trying to get control
of the flight.

735
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:55,035
I will kill you.

736
00:49:57,385 --> 00:49:59,039
[breathing heavily]

737
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:05,306
This is Mark Six
Mjolnir armor.

738
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,526
The outer layer
is enhanced titanium.

739
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:09,136
You won't even dent it.

740
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,591
[air hisses]

741
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,870
If you want me dead...

742
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,569
you'll need to aim up here.

743
00:50:52,614 --> 00:50:54,703
What just happened?

744
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:56,401
[rapid beeping]

745
00:50:56,444 --> 00:50:57,967
I think he just took off
his helmet.

746
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:07,412
-What are you doing?
-Trying to help you.

747
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:09,109
If this ship lands,

748
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:11,416
they will remove you
and execute you.

749
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:20,251
They told you this?

750
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,733
And you just decided
to help me?

751
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:30,087
Why would a Spartan do that?

752
00:51:33,438 --> 00:51:34,830
I don't know.

753
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,140
Get me thermal imaging
on the Condor.

754
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:41,750
[technician]
Right away.

755
00:51:56,548 --> 00:51:58,724
So what now?

756
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,904
We need to work fast.

757
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:08,342
[Keyes] There's
a weapon signature on the girl.

758
00:52:08,386 --> 00:52:12,955
Did your Spartan just give
an insurgent a rifle?

759
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:15,871
Green Deck, two minutes
till touchdown.

760
00:52:15,915 --> 00:52:17,090
Two minutes!

761
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:24,924
[soldier]
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

762
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,404
[overlapping shouts]

763
00:52:31,887 --> 00:52:33,324
Open ECAM panel two.

764
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:35,630
Disconnect the AI
autopilot fail-safe.

765
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:38,111
-Autopilot what?
-[John] ECAM panel two!

766
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,547
That's how we get control
of the ship.

767
00:52:41,114 --> 00:52:42,855
-Rip out the cables to the FMS!
-Which cables?

768
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:44,683
I need to disconnect
the stabilizer servos

769
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:47,251
at the same time, otherwise
we lose complete control.

770
00:52:57,652 --> 00:52:58,871
I can't! They're stuck!

771
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:00,612
Must work faster, Kwan!

772
00:53:00,655 --> 00:53:01,656
I'm trying!

773
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:06,879
[soldier]
Go! Go! Go!

774
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:09,751
[indistinct shouts]

775
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,188
[grunts]
Shit!

776
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:16,367
[alarms beeping]

777
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,586
[powering down]

778
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,501
[computerized voice]
...now in manual mode.

779
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:23,069
You are now in manual mode.

780
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:25,637
[alarm beeping]

781
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,465
He's disabled the AI.

782
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:29,075
Flying manually, ma'am.

783
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:33,166
What are we waiting for?
I thought you had control.

784
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,516
I do. Hang on.

785
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,562
Captain...

786
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:39,607
This is Keyes.
Pulse the ship

787
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:41,609
before he can load
fire controls.

788
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:42,567
Knock it down!

789
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,484
[sharp grunt]

790
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:52,098
[loud crash]

791
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,360
[artifact clatters]

792
00:53:53,404 --> 00:53:55,536
[solider]
Let's go! Move!

793
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,929
[breathing heavily]

794
00:53:58,365 --> 00:53:59,714
[solider]
Move! Flanking starboard!

795
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,543
Halt! Cover me!

796
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:03,501
Ready!

797
00:54:10,377 --> 00:54:11,944
[soldier]
Bravo Two, at the door!

798
00:54:13,424 --> 00:54:15,164
[soldier 2]
Hold your line!

799
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,427
In your ranks!

800
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,993
Hold your section!

801
00:54:18,037 --> 00:54:19,299
What do we do?

802
00:54:19,343 --> 00:54:20,561
[panting]

803
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,608
[soldier]
Prepare to breach!

804
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:25,305
What do we do?

805
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:27,873
-All engines dead.
-No response.

806
00:54:27,916 --> 00:54:29,570
Drop the girl.

807
00:54:31,093 --> 00:54:32,965
And if he makes a move,
drop him too.

808
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:36,882
Shit.

809
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:41,582
Master Chief, please tell me
you have a plan.

810
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:51,157
[soldier]
Placing charges!

811
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,899
[beeping]

812
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,169
Master Chief!

813
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:16,965
[artifact clicking]

814
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:19,794
[energy flows]

815
00:55:27,498 --> 00:55:30,849
[beeping]

816
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:36,594
[laughing]

817
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,297
-[Young John] Want to see?
-[mother] Of course.

818
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:52,349
[energy powers down]

819
00:55:52,392 --> 00:55:53,828
[woman]
What just happened?

820
00:55:53,872 --> 00:55:55,308
Debasement status?

821
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:59,399
[systems powering up]

822
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:08,974
A.I. is disengaged.

823
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:11,759
What did you just do?

824
00:56:11,803 --> 00:56:13,413
[technician]
Switching to auxiliary power.

825
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:14,719
[Parangosky]
What was that?

826
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:16,721
[overlapping chatter]

827
00:56:16,764 --> 00:56:18,418
[grunts]

828
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:21,639
[all shouting]

829
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:26,905
Strap in.

830
00:56:56,674 --> 00:57:00,852
[end theme music playing]
